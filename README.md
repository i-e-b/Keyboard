## Parts

### Recovered & 2nd hand:

The keyswitches came from a second-hand Dell AT102W mechanical keyboard from eBay, about £30.
Brand new keys are available for £42 -- http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ELAXK98

Wires were from an old ethernet cable (these work out very well and are cheaper than regular cable)

### New
